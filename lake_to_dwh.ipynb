    "\n",
    "### What the Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Loading and Parsing:**  \n",
    "  The notebook reads HTML files containing newspaper articles along with their corresponding metadata from a CSV file. It then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract only the relevant content needed for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Processing and Preparation:**  \n",
    "  The extracted content is processed to isolate the contexts in which the term \"klima\" appears. This includes capturing the surrounding text to better understand the usage and meaning of the word in each article.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Storage:**  \n",
    "  The processed data is structured and stored in a SQLite database with two tables. This ensures that the data is organized, easily accessible, and ready for further analysis. It will also export the data as csv for an easy import to other programms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Table: newspaper**  \n",
    "  Stores metadata about each newspaper's main page, including the publication details corresponding to a single day.  \n",
    "  Each entry represents the main page of a newspaper for one day, as the dataset is derived from crawling the main page rather than individual articles. \n",
    "  **Columns:**  \n",
    "  - `newspaper_id`  \n",
    "  - `newspaper_name`  \n",
    "  - `data_published`  \n",
    "  - `klima_mentions_count`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Table: context**  \n",
    "  Contains detailed text snippets surrounding the target word \"klima\". The id refers to a newspaper (main page) from one specific day. \n",
    "  **Columns:**  \n",
    "  - `newspaper_id`  \n",
    "  - `pre_context`  \n",
    "  - `post_context`  \n",
    "  - `prefix`  \n",
    "  - `suffix`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focused Analysis:**  \n",
    "  By isolating the contexts where \"klima\" is mentioned, the notebook prepares data specifically tailored to analyze the evolution of the term's usage over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Organization:**  \n",
    "  Storing data in a structured SQLite database facilitates efficient querying and analysis, ensuring that subsequent analytical processes can be performed seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reproducibility and Scalability:**  \n",
    "  This clear separation of tasks—from data extraction to storage—supports a reproducible workflow that can easily be extended or modified for future analytical targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional details and background, please refer to the README file.\n"
