Abstract

ABSTRACT This article adapts and applies a securitisation framework to produce an analytical explanation for the heightened geopolitical status of climate change over the past decade, as demonstrated by the breakthrough Paris Agreement of 2015. Rather than speech acts invoking security, the focus of this analysis is on the socio-scientific discourse of global climate crisis that emerged in the several year period leading to the 2009 COP 15 conference in Copenhagen. Two types of experts---contributory and interactional---are identified as the essential and interdependent actors that engaged in 'crisification', a novel crisis-based perspective on political agenda setting, in which climate crisis served as a primary discursive device employed by prominent advocates of urgent action. Contributory experts, that is, authoritative climate scientists and their institutions, together with interactional experts---non-scientist social actors who appropriated and mediated scientific data and knowledge in framing climate change as a global crisis---constituted an extended epistemic community of climate advocates. Through an array of speech acts, this extended community effectively co-constructed a convincing climate crisis discourse that consisted of quantitative data artefacts based on CO2 concentration and global mean temperature, and qualitative invocations of existential threat to human civilisation, which contributed to the ascent of climate change on the global political agenda. In proposing crisification as a complement to securitisation, the article offers a theoretical innovation that facilitates constructivist analysis of issues framed as crises, including geopolitical problems in certain non-military sectors where crisis is a favoured label for perceived threats to core values.

### Climate concepts for supporting political goals of mitigation and adaptation: The case for "climate crisis"Climate concepts for supporting political goals of mitigation and adaptation: The case for "climate crisis"

Abstract

Climate concepts are crucial to understand the effects of human activity on the climate system scientifically, and to formulate and pursue policies to mitigate and adapt to these effects. Yet, scientists, policymakers, and activists often use different terms such as "global warming," "climate change," "climate crisis," or "climate emergency." This advanced review investigates which climate concept is most suitable when we pursue mitigation and adaptation goals in a scientifically informed manner. It first discusses how survey experiments and social science reviews on climate frames draw normative recommendations about which terms to use for public climate communication. It is suggested that such normative claims can be refined by including the scientific alongside lay uses of a climate concept, and by using explicit assessment conditions to evaluate how suitable a concept is for formulating mitigation and adaptation goals. Drawing on philosophical theories of conceptual change in science and conceptual engineering, a novel framework with two assessment conditions is introduced and then applied to "global warming," "climate change," "climate emergency," and "climate crisis." The assessment suggests that currently, "climate crisis" is most suitable to formulate and pursue climate mitigation and adaptation goals. Using this concept promotes the epistemic goals of climate science to a high degree, bridges scientific, political, and activist discourse, and fosters for democratic participation when articulating climate policies.

„Klimawandel" war lange der dominante Begriff, gilt aber als relativ neutral und wird zunehmend von „Klimakrise" abgelöst, um die Dringlichkeit und Bedrohlichkeit stärker zu betonen. gibt es diesbzeüglich studien?

"Klimakrise" ist derzeit der am besten geeignete Begriff, um Ziele der Klimaminderung und -anpassung zu verfolgen, da er die epistemischen Ziele der Klimawissenschaft fördert und den wissenschaftlichen, politischen und aktivistischen Diskurs verbindet.

Abstract

News organizations increasingly use the terms "climate emergency" and "climate crisis" to convey the urgency of climate change; yet, little is known about how this terminology affects news audiences. This study experimentally examined how using "climate emergency," "climate crisis," or "climate change" in Twitter-based news stories influences public engagement with climate change and news perceptions, as well as whether the effects depend on the focus of the news (i.e., on climate impacts, actions, or both impacts and actions) and on participants' political ideology. Results showed no effect of terminology on climate change engagement; however, "climate emergency" reduced perceived news credibility and newsworthiness compared to "climate change." Both climate engagement and news perceptions were more consistently affected by the focus of the stories: news about climate impacts increased fear, decreased efficacy beliefs and hope, and reduced news credibility compared to news about climate actions. No interactions with political ideology were found.

Die Verwendung der Begriffe "Klimanotstand" und "Klimakrise" in Nachrichtenberichten verringert die wahrgenommene Glaubwürdigkeit und Nachrichtenwürdigkeit, beeinflusst jedoch das Engagement für den Klimawandel nicht signifikant.

From "Climate Change" to "Climate Crisis"?

Abstract

Climate change is one of the core challenges of humankind -- and legacy news media continue to be important sources of information about the issue for many people around the globe. Accordingly, how news media portray climate change is important for public awareness and perceptions of the issue. The labeling of the topic -- which may rely on more neutral terms like "climate change" or "global warming" or more alarming terms like "climate crisis", "climate emergency" or "global heating" -- is an important facet in this respect. In step with the increasing importance of the issue, outlets such as the British "Guardian" have switched to these more urgent terms in their coverage of climate change. But it is unclear, so far, how pronounced this switch is, and which media have followed suit. Relying on an automated content analysis of climate change coverage from 16 news outlets in eight countries around the world between 1996 and 2021 (N = 89,887), our study investigates the use and proliferation of "climate change compounds" such as "climate crisis", "global heating", or "global warming" used to describe the phenomenon. We find that news media still use neutral terms -- especially "climate change" -- more often than alarming labels. However, the use of the latter has increased strongly since 2019, presumably due to country-specific events and changes in editorial guidelines of national outlets.

Risk? Crisis? Emergency? Implications of the new climate emergency framing for governance and policy

Abstract

The term "climate emergency" represents a new phase in climate change framing that many hope will invigorate more climate action. Yet there has been relatively little discussion of how the new emergency framing might shape broader governance and policy. In this advanced review, we critically review and synthesize existing literature on crisis and emergency to inform our understanding of how this new shift might affect governance and policy. Specifically, we explore the literature on crisis governance and policy to argue that there is no simple answer to whether the "climate emergency" framing will be supportive of climate governance and policy; rather, more work needs to be done to understand how different political actors respond according to their perceptions, interests and values. To assist this endeavor, we develop a typology of four policy pathways, ranging from "no emergency," to "no emergency, but recognize risk," "emergency as a threat" and "emergency as an opportunity." We highlight the need to consider the effects of multiple and overlapping emergency frames, using the example of the intersection of climate change and COVID‐19. Finally, we suggest new interdisciplinary research directions for critically analyzing and refining this new phase of climate change framing.
